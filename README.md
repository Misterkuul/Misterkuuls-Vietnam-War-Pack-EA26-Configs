# Misterkuuls-Vietnam-War-Pack-EA26-Configs

How To Download
1: Download Modlist (There is an option to download everything in 1 go, It's the + button above the modpack)
2: Go to my GitHub
3: Press "Code" and then Download Zip
4: In your search bar type in: "C:\Users\YOUR-PC-NAME\AppData\LocalLow\SteelRaven7\RavenfieldSteam\GameConfigurations"
5: Drag the files in the Zip to your "GameConfigurations" map
6: You can now play, have fun! :)

Note:
-By the YOUR-PC-NAME section you need to write the name of your pc
-I have my Ravenfield on my C disc but if you don't have that, change the C to whatever you called your disc

Ps.
The reason I have my Configs on Github is that uploading configs is annoying and I'm not gonna do it 8 times, if you want to upload my configs you are allowed to do that, just give me a link so that I can add it in the steam description.
